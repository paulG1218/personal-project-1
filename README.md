# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


This Is my first full stack project with a DB and it has many user, and admin, features. I used PostgreSQL for my database, express for my backend and React/React Bootstap/CSS for front end and styling.

If you want to check it out for yourslef, git clone the repo and use the terminal to run "npm i" and "npm run dev" to start the server and "npm run initdb" and "npm run seed" to fill the database with sample data. Thanks for checking it out!
